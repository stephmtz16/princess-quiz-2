# Princess Quiz

This is the base code to help create a "Princess Quiz". This code should be able to help you create a mutlipe choice quiz to find the overall average of the test. In this example I made a "What Flower Are You", were I ask five questions to find out what Flower you are based on how you answered the question. In this example you will see code that asks the user to enter in one letter to answer the question. However, hopefully with some more practice you will be able to have the users code out full word to answer the questions.
